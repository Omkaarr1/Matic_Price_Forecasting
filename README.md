  - Key performance metrics like RMSE and R² scores.
  - Strengths and weaknesses of each model.

### **2. Model Performance Comparisons**
- A **detailed table** comparing all models:
  - RMSE values for accuracy measurement.
  - R² scores for goodness-of-fit.
  - A summary of each model's strengths and weaknesses.

### **3. Visual Representations**
- An interactive gallery showcasing:
  - Architecture diagrams.
  - Predictions for each model compared with actual data.

### **4. Results Section**
- A **summary of key findings**:
  - Analysis of the best-performing model (GNU+GRU Hybrid).
  - Discussion of each model’s limitations and use cases.

### **5. Aesthetic UI**
- A modern, responsive design with:
  - Gradient background.
